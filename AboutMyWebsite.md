# About My Portfolio Website
## A Reflection by Joseph Metzen

Hey everyone, my name is Joseph Metzen. I want to walk you through my portfolio website and talk about why I built it the way I did.

## [ON HERO SECTION - Landing Page]

So here we are on the landing page. I'm a Computer Engineering student at Iowa State, and I work on everything from hardware to software. I needed a website that could showcase all these different sides - building robots, designing processors, making apps - without being confusing or overwhelming.

I built this using React 18 and Vite. Coming from a background in Java and embedded C programming, React was actually pretty new for me. But I liked how it breaks everything into components - that's exactly how I think when working on hardware or breaking down big projects.

For styling, I used Tailwind CSS, which let me work really fast. I added dark mode, go to the top right corner of the page and click on the sun and it changes to light mode. I started out in dark mode because my eyes are sensitive to bright lights and dark mode helps with doing homeowork late at night. A

The animated background has circuit patterns and binary code to give that computer engineering vibes. 

## [SCROLLING TO ABOUT SECTION]

Now as we scroll down to the about section, you can see I broke down what I do into three main areas: Software Development, Systems Engineering, and Hardware Integration.

I'm currently working as a systems engineering intern at EnCompass, where I focus on network systems, learning new applications, and fixing people issues. What I really love is building things that connect hardware and software - whether it's autonomous vehicles or network infrastructure.

## [SCROLLING TO SKILLS SECTION]

Here in the skills section, I didn't just want to list technologies. I added star ratings because I think it's more honest. I gave myself 5 stars in Java and Git because I use those all the time and I'm really comfortable with them. Other things are 4 stars because I'm good at them but not an expert yet.

You can also filter by category - Languages, Frameworks, or Tools - so you can quickly find what you're looking for.

## [SCROLLING TO PROJECTS SECTION]

This projects section is really the heart of the site. I featured three main projects plus my senior design work.

First is my Fitness Workout Android App - a full-stack project with Android frontend and Spring Boot backend. It's got user management, workout tracking, nutrition features, and even real-time chat with WebSockets. This shows I can build complete applications from start to finish.

Then there's the CyBot Autonomous Vehicle. This is all embedded systems and C programming. I programmed sensors, integrated them together, and made a robot that drives itself and avoids obstacles. That's the hardware-software integration I really enjoy.

The third is a MIPS Processor I designed in VHDL. I literally built a processor from scratch with all the pipeline stages and hazard detection. This shows I understand how computers work at the lowest level.

And then my senior design project gets special attention because we're working on assistive technology for people with cerebral palsy. I'm optimizing machine learning models to run on embedded hardware - combining ML, embedded systems, and actually helping people. That's the kind of work that really matters to me.

## [SCROLLING TO REFLECTIONS SECTION]

I also included my reflection papers - on ethics, general education, and my overall college experience. Engineering has a big impact on society, and I think it's important to reflect on that.


## [STILL ON REFLECTIONS/CONTACT - Learning & Growth]

For every one of these projects, I had to learn things on my own beyond just class material. With the fitness app, I spent hours in Spring Boot documentation, Android developer guides, Stack Overflow, reaching out to TAs and other students when I got stuck.

For my senior design project, I had to read research papers on U-Net architecture, go through Xilinx documentation, experiment with optimization techniques. That's not something they teach step-by-step in class - you have to figure it out.

My internship at EnCompass reinforced this too. Working on real network systems, you can't wait for someone to teach you - you figure it out through documentation, testing, and experience.

## [THINKING ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE]

[GO to senior design project]

Understanding the impact of what we build has become really important to me. My senior design project is a perfect example - we're creating assistive technology for people with cerebral palsy. That's someone's independence and quality of life we're improving through engineering. That really matters.


[GO BACK TO REFLECTION

This made me think a lot about ethics and responsibility. How do we make sure this technology is reliable? What if the system makes a mistake? These aren't just technical questions - they're about our responsibility as engineers.

Even with the fitness app, we're handling personal health data and payment systems. You have to protect user privacy and be honest about what you're doing with people's information.

At EnCompass, working on network infrastructure and cloud systems, we consider environmental impact too. Data centers use massive amounts of energy, so we think about virtualization and efficiency - not just to save money, but because it's better for the environment.

## [SCROLLING TO CONTACT - Wrapping Up]

So that's my portfolio website and what it represents. This isn't just a showcase of projects - it shows where I am today as an engineer. I can learn new technologies on my own, build complete projects from scratch, and think about the impact of what I build - whether that's helping people with disabilities, protecting user data, or considering environmental impact.

Learning doesn't stop at graduation. Technology changes constantly. That's why I stay involved beyond classwork through my internship, and that's why writing those reflection papers mattered - they made me realize that being a good engineer isn't just about coding or designing circuits. It's about understanding your responsibility to society.

Every project taught me something new. Building this website itself was a lesson in turning an idea into reality. I'm excited to keep learning and growing, and I'll keep this site updated as I go.

That's what engineering is really about - always learning, always building, always moving forward. Thanks for checking out my work.
