# About My Portfolio Website
## A Reflection by Joseph Metzen

Hey everyone, I want to walk you through my portfolio website and why I built it the way I did.

I'm a Computer Engineering student at Iowa State, and I work on everything from hardware to software. I needed a website that could show all these different sides - building robots, designing processors, making apps - without being confusing or overwhelming.

## The Tech Stack and Design

I built this using React 18 and Vite. Coming from a background in Java and embedded C programming, React was pretty new for me. But I liked how it breaks everything into components - that's how I already think when working on hardware or big projects.

For styling, I used Tailwind CSS, which let me work really fast. I added dark mode because, let's be real, staring at a bright screen during late night coding sessions is not fun. And I kept everything on one page so you just scroll through - intro, skills, projects, contact info. It flows better that way.

For the design, I wanted something modern but not overwhelming. The animated background has circuit patterns and binary code - subtle computer engineering vibes. The blue to purple to pink gradients work in both light and dark mode and tie everything together.

## The Projects

The projects section is really the heart of the site. I featured three main projects plus my senior design work.

First is my Fitness Workout Android App - a full-stack project with Android frontend and Spring Boot backend. It's got user management, workout tracking, nutrition features, and even real-time chat with WebSockets. This shows I can build complete applications from start to finish.

Then there's the CyBot Autonomous Vehicle. This is all embedded systems and C programming. I programmed sensors, integrated them together, and made a robot that drives itself and avoids obstacles. That's the hardware-software integration I really enjoy.

The third is a MIPS Processor I designed in VHDL. I literally built a processor from scratch with all the pipeline stages and hazard detection. This shows I understand how computers work at the lowest level.

My senior design project gets special attention because we're working on assistive technology for people with cerebral palsy. I'm optimizing machine learning models to run on embedded hardware - combining ML, embedded systems, and actually helping people.

I also included my reflection papers on ethics, general education, and my overall college experience. Engineering has a big impact on society, and I think it's important to reflect on that.


## Learning and Growing

For every project, I had to learn things on my own beyond just class material. With the fitness app, I spent hours in Spring Boot documentation, Android developer guides, Stack Overflow, and reaching out to TAs and other students.

For my senior design project, I had to read research papers on U-Net architecture, go through Xilinx documentation, and experiment with optimization techniques. That's not something they teach step-by-step in class.

My internship at EnCompass reinforced this too. Working on real network systems, you can't wait for someone to teach you - you figure it out through documentation, testing, and experience.

## The Bigger Picture

Understanding the impact of what we build has become really important to me. My senior design project is a perfect example - we're creating assistive technology for people with cerebral palsy. That's someone's independence and quality of life we're improving through engineering.

This made me think about ethics and responsibility. How do we make sure this technology is reliable? What if the system makes a mistake? These aren't just technical questions - they're about our responsibility as engineers.

Even with the fitness app, we're handling personal health data and payment systems. You have to protect user privacy and be honest about what you're doing with people's information.

At EnCompass, working on network infrastructure and cloud systems, we consider environmental impact too. Data centers use massive amounts of energy, so we think about virtualization and efficiency - not just to save money, but because it's better for the environment.

## Continuous Learning

Learning doesn't stop at graduation. Technology changes constantly, which is why I stay involved beyond classwork. My EnCompass internship teaches me things you can't get in a classroom - real enterprise systems, real problems, how things work in industry.

Writing those reflection papers made me think differently about my education. The ethics reflection especially made me realize that being a good engineer isn't just about coding or designing circuits - it's about understanding your responsibility to society.

## Wrapping Up

This portfolio represents where I am today as an engineer. It shows I can learn new technologies on my own, build complete projects from scratch, and think about the impact of what I build - whether that's helping people with disabilities, protecting user data, or considering environmental impact.

Every project taught me something new. Building this website itself was a lesson in turning an idea into reality. I'm excited to keep learning and growing, and I'll keep this site updated as I go. That's what engineering is really about - always learning, always building, always moving forward.

Thanks for checking out my work.
